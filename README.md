Installation

You will need the standard data science libraries found in the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

For this project, I was interestested in analyzing data from AirBnB homes located in Berlin and Munich. Specifically, I looked at the following questions:

  1.How many listings are there for each price category? How does this compare from Berlin to Munich?
  2.How are the cost categories and the cleaning fee related? How does this compare from Berlin to Munich?
  3.Is there a relationship between the cost categories and the review scores? How are the review scores compare from Berlin to Munich?
